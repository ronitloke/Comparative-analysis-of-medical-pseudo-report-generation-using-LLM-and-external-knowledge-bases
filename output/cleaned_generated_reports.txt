Report: Multiple findings are present including bilateral perihilar opacities, possible effusions indicated by blunting of the costophrenic angles, and potential atelectasis or consolidation in the region of the minor fissure. Atherosclerotic and mitral annular calcifications are noted, alongside an enlarged cardiac silhouette. There are also multiple compression deformities in the thoracic and lumbar spine.   Additional findings include moderate enlargement of the heart, central vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema and right lower and middle lobe densities which may indicate consolidations. No pneumothorax is seen.  The presence of multifocal regions of consolidation are compatible with metastatic lesions in the lungs. However, no definitive acute cardiopulmonary process is identified.  Chronic pulmonary fibrotic changes are noted extensively, especially in the peripheral basal regions. Cardiomegaly is moderate and stable. There is no identified pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increasing bibasilar opacities may suggest atelectasis. The presence of small bilateral pleural effusions are probable. Interstitial thickening in the lingula is suggested by a shaggy heart border. Interstitial lung markings consistent with chronic interstitial lung disease were observed throughout the lung, potentially indicating volume loss. Bilateral shoulder injuries are noted including a dislocated left glenohumeral joint and a fractured right proximal humerus.

Report: Moderate right pleural effusion with associated right lower lobe volume loss, possible underlying infection. Small left pleural effusion with associated left lower lobe volume loss. Diffuse nodular parenchymal opacities increasing in extent and severity in the right lung. Severe cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. Possibility of compressive atelectasis due to patchy lung base opacities. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with potential adjacent compressive atelectasis and underlying consolidation at the right base. Presence of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and potential pneumonia particularly in the right lower lobe. Moderate-to-large-sized pleural effusion with multiple septations/locations and underlying consolidation signifying thoracic empyema. Compressive atelectasis associated with right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion, left upper zone mass, and enlarged cardiac silhouette may indicate re-expansion pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the bilateral mid to lower zones and left retrocardiac regions suggesting potential worsening infective changes, adjacent left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.

Report: The first report shows a well-expanded and clear lung with normal heart size and no sign of intrathoracic process. Second report presents a normal chest radiograph with clear lungs, normal heart size, and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Third report also describes clear lungs without signs of consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax, and normal cardiopulmonary silhouette. Similarly, the fourth report shows clear and well-expanded lungs without pleural effusion, pneumothorax or abnormality in the heart. In the fifth report, the lungs are free from consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax, and no evidence of significant free air presence, indicating no acute cardiopulmonary process. Finally, although incidents of a prominent left rhomboid fossa of the clavicle and a right nipple stud are mentioned, the lungs and cardiomediastinal contours remain normal. The latter reports indicate no symptoms of pneumonia, and in the patient with Myasthenia gravis, no signs of anterior superior mediastinal mass with clear lungs, and normal heart, mediastinum, pulmonary vessels, and diaphragm. Overall, all reports suggest normal cardiopulmonary findings without the presence of acute intrathoracic processes.

Report: 1. Reduced size of right pleural effusion and presence of small left pleural effusion. 2. Unchanged left apical cavitary lesion and large hiatal hernia noted. 3. Left perihilar consolidation aligning with the region of left lower lobe bronchiectasis. 4. Likely atelectasis or re-expansion edema at the right lung base with a normal size cardiomediastinal silhouette. No pneumothorax detected. 5. Increased fluid accumulation in the left pleural space with vascular congestion. 6. Decreased extent and severity of atelectasis in both right and left lung bases with expanded lung parenchyma. 7. Pronounced cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum with the development of pulmonary edema, potential for infection in right lower lobe consolidation and potential right pleural effusion.  8. Enlarged left pleural effusion with collapsed and/or consolidated left lower lobe, and improved right costophrenic angle blunting. Hyperinflation suggestive of COPD.  9. Notable mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a right upper zone nodule. Slight volume loss on the left with atelectasis and/or scarring.  10. Left-sided large pneumothorax, underlying lung collapse with no mediastinal shift and clear right lung. 11. Large, dilated, tortuous aortic arch and descending aorta causing mass effect on the trachea

Report: Moderate bilateral interstitial edema with a possibility of atypical infection, and the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted. Signs of increased interstitial markings that may indicate worsening of known diffuse fibrotic interstitial lung disease or possible superimposed vascular congestion. Mild bilateral interstitial edema is persistent. The left hemidiaphragm demonstrates elevation with possible indications of atelectasis and tiny pleural effusions. Severe pulmonary interstitial abnormalities are visible, potentially due to interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed on moderate pulmonary emphysema. The presence of a possible superimposed infectious process is not ruled out. There exists an air-fluid level behind the heart suggestive of hiatus hernia, bilateral interstitial opacities hinting at miliary tuberculosis, and multiple intrapulmonary masses. Large pericardial effusion is evident with signs of the water bottle sign and enlarged pulmonary vasculature. Additionally, there are diffusely increased, inhomogeneous interstitial markings.

Report: Bilateral pulmonary congestion, emphysematous changes, and atelectasis with stable cardiomegaly. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, bibasilar opacities likely indicative of atelectasis, alongside mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Presence of bibasilar opacities possibly reflective of either atelectasis or aspiration/pneumonia, and mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Reduced lung volumes causing crowding of bronchovascular structures, innumerable pulmonary metastases and bibasilar atelectasis. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis in the scenario of low lung volumes. Finally, evidence of interstitial lung markings attributable to chronic interstitial lung disease with a missed splenic shadow, indicative of sickle cell disease with acute chest syndrome, alongside a mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

Report: Moderate pulmonary edema with small to moderate bilateral effusions, pointing towards significant cardiomegaly. Mild probable atelectasis present in the lower lung zones. No evident pneumothorax. Presence also noted of pleural airspace disease, likely due to partial lower lobe atelectasis, though definitive exclusion of pneumonia is not possible.

Report: 1. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process in a patient presenting with back pain and fever. 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process in a patient with chest pain. 3. No acute cardiopulmonary process in a patient with chest pain, with clear lungs and no signs of infection or pneumothorax. 4. Bilateral changes in the perihilar regions of the lungs, suggestive of underlying scarring. Presence of opacities, particularly in the right lower lung, may be suggestive of superimposed infection or an acute process. 5. Cardiomegaly, hilar congestion, and mild pulmonary edema observed in a patient with reported cough and dyspnea on exertion. There is no large effusion, pneumothorax, or signs of pneumonia, and bony structures are intact. 6. Incidental findings of an azygos fissure with mild opacity in the inferior aspect. Presence of a painless right chest wall mass lateral to the nipple, with intact skin, suggestive of a lung cancer case. A similar finding of a probable esophageal carcinoma case characterised by a posterior mediastinal density on a lateral projection.

Report: The examination reveals a large volume removal of right pleural effusion with no definite pneumothorax. There is an increased opacification in the lower right hemithorax due to severe chronic pulmonary disease and scarring that indicates a possible developing pneumonia. There is also an increased pleural effusion on the left, a severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.   In addition, the examination also highlights worsening of areas of consolidation and interstitial prominence throughout both lung fields, with more confluent areas of consolidation in the perihilar regions and in the left base. This may indicate multifocal pneumonia or superimposed pulmonary edema.  Furthermore, an increase in both right and left pleural effusions is noted, along with consolidation in the right lower and middle lobes. No evident pneumothorax is identified. Both right mid-lung consolidation and interstitial changes appear extensive and are concerning for an infectious process.   Patchy airspace opacities are seen in the mid to lower zones bilaterally and left retrocardiac region suggestive of worsening infective changes. A small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is also noted.  There are moderate to large pleural effusions with multiple septations and underlying consolidation, which is indicative of thoracic empyema. Finally, a large retrocardiac cystic lesion with air/fluid level is indicative of a hiatus hernia.
